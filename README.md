## 🎓 Student Grade Tracker — Java GUI Project

### 📘 Overview

The **Student Grade Tracker** is a **Java-based desktop application** that helps manage student records, calculate grades, and display results using a simple graphical interface built with **Swing** and **AWT**.

This project was developed as part of my learning journey with **@CodeAlpha**, focusing on applying **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and core Java concepts in a real-world scenario.
